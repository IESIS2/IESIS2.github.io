      <p>Before we start developing the code for the collisions we need to set up the environment in which the collisions will occur.  It will need to ensure that both energy and momentum are conserved for all objects even when they are not colliding.  That means that the balls must not bounce off the walls.  Instead they will pass through the walls and wrap around to the opposite wall, like the old arcade game ‘Asteroids’.</p>

      <p>A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>
